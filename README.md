# Basic-R projects 

This Repo has some of my basic project in R.
R comes with a vast assortment of statistical and graphical methods including linear regression, time series, statistical inference linear and non-linear modeling, classification, clustering, ML algorithms, and much more. Also, R has top-notch tools for visualization, reporting, and interactivity, which are crucial both for Data Science and business domains. The cherry on top â€“ R includes packages covering a wide range of topics on the business front like finance and econometrics.
